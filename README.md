# Voxel Engine

This project is a voxel engine made from Scratch for fun mainly.
This engine is designed as a library, in order to be integrated into any C++ game project.
It has the goal to be very extensible/modifiable. (Yet as the current state of development it is not the case)




## State of the project

This project is far from being released yet.

## Specifications

This project is made using C++, OpenGL with GLEW and GLFW, std_image library for textures.

In the future, we would like to add other rendering methods, such as a custom software renderer and maybe Vulkan and WebGL
